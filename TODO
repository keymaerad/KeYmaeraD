-replace == with := for assignments
-replace x' with x for assignments, afaik ' only means derivate in assignement and flows otherwise means post value
-x != 0 in spaceex not working
-add examples
 -id edges and id locations
 -disjunktion in guard / invariant
 -every hybrid program operator
 -reursive and & or
 -disjunktion in linear constraint


-also usefull in sense that formula modelisation easier then automata modelisation?

-contact

 -goran fresh
 -phou

-every formula -> spaceex
-* assignments

-examples
 -keymaera
 -niko
 -literature
  -spaceex examples
-speeder
 -linear diff eqS?
-more powerfull
 -linearize
  -ask goran non linear
  -not a priority since spaceex will eventually linearize?
 -other forumla forms -- when keymaeraD transforms the forumla + multiple hybrid systems interacting
  -on automata level
  -on hybrid program level
  -on run level


-optimasation
 -unfold *

-catch non linearity
-nice-ize code

-ask david if he could check the scala code style
 -locations.foreach(l => l.autom = this) kinda ugly
 -get rid of the two warnings
 -NoClassDefFoundError
 -test1.dl not parsing
 -how is Automaton#Location called and what diff exactly w Location
 -assert instead of exception in patern matching? -- afaik assert for internal error, exception for usage error
 -declare but define later

---parallel
-how powerfull/weak is the translation

---eventually
-make more powerfull
 -e.g. indepedent hybrid systems -> several indepedent spaceex runs
-simulate * assignement by not setting flow in spaceex xml input
-sanetize varS && quantifier -- make sure every var has unique name and eliminate forall quantifiers

---done
-spaceex unexpected output
-unbounded sets error
-prob: start loc shouldn't be an end state but seems to be
-alternative for isendstate:  forbidden+= "& loc(endstate)"
-set forbidden state space: negate good state space
-set init and end states
-graph output
-branch of main impl
-make bouncing ball work
-adapt transition guards to spaceex
-adapt location invariants to spaceex
-spaceex doesn't cope multiple tags

=== SpaceEx notes
-composition: a jump in one base automaton requires a jump in all other automata
-multiple same tag: SpaceEx will only consider last tag and ignore the others
-use := instead of == in <assignment>
